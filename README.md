Alpha Progress Example
======================

Small example on a way to implement a custom progress spinner in Android. The spinner works on all backgrounds since it's drawing with alpha.

The example was shown on GDG Stockholm January meetup 2013.

Screenshot showing the result on different backgrounds:
